1. console commands (use them always when you started your world)

gfx af (if 2gb vram)
gfx af 0 (if 4gb vram)

2. launcher settings

run game through the launcher and set:
	- "Show this launcher on the next start" to true
	- "Exclusive Fullscreen Mode" to true
	- "Use EasyAntiCheat (EAC)" to false

then click "Run & Save"
next time you can just start game and you'll see the launcher, just click "Run" there

go to your game's installation folder
right click on the game executables (7daystodie.exe, 7daystodieeac.exe)
